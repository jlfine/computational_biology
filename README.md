## Computational biology programs
A collection of some programs I've written to perform useful tasks and exercises in bioinformatics, which have been relevant to my graduate research work. Topics covered include:

- Binary searches for nucleic acid polymers
- De bruijn graphs for analyzing nucleic acid k-mers
- Prefix trees / Tries for analyzing nucleic acid k-mers
- Cellular automata
- Longest substring algorithms
- Markov chains
- Hidden markov models (HMMs)
- Fasta & csv file processing
